# CSS_GND
This is the repo for the eth zurich seminar "computational social science".

In order to run the GND algorithm  of Ren et al., you should run the matlab file GND.m. On the top, you can define whether you want to run it for degree-based cost or an arbitrary cost and whether to use the spectral approximation. Also, you can set the target value k (relative size of the largest connected component). For a test, change the dataset:
